                <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
                <p>My name is Jesse Watson. I’m 17 years old and love technology. I’m one of those annoying Apple fans,
                    but
                    strangely working backwards with the products I buy - first an iPad, then a Mac and hopefully soon
                    that
                    slick iPhone 13 Mini. I value fitness, running and mountain biking being my favourite fitness
                    activities. I also value my relationship with my family, friends and God.</p>
                <p>In a team environment, I can struggle with putting myself out there, but I push through those
                    barriers
                    and have great experiences because of it. I also am quite a perfectionist (which isn’t always the
                    best
                    trait) and pride myself on being organised and on time.</p>
                <p>I enjoy being creative, usually through the lens of a camera and the timeline in a video editing
                    software
                    (Final Cut Pro X). I have a YouTube channel where I share with the world these creations. And I’m
                    now
                    developing my creative muscle in programming. </p>

                <h3>My Interest in IT</h3>
                <p>I’m very interested in the world of IT. I’ve always wanted to know how to code, and I’ve started by
                    making my own website using WordPress templates. By taking a course in Programming and IT, I’m
                    taking my
                    first steps to make this website from scratch myself.</p>
                <p>I’m also interested in VR, AR and what the Metaverse can offer humanity, although I’m quite cautious
                    at
                    the same time.</p>

                <h3>The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator</h3>
                <p>After receiving the results from my personality test, I’ve discovered my strengths and weaknesses. We
                    all
                    know that conflict is inevitable, there will always be a disagreement at some point when working in
                    a
                    team. Based on the results from the test, I am a (Turbulent) Defender, which suggests that I’m
                    naturally
                    shy but caring. I’m an introvert but enjoy a regular connection with others and would call anyone I
                    get
                    along with a friend. Although I am kind and considerate, it is always likely that conflicts will
                    occur
                    in the workplace. In such an event, I will venture to understand the motivations of each side and
                    figure
                    out a solution in a civil way. Although I can struggle with confrontation, I don’t like to get angry
                    at
                    others, but rather be respectful and talk about the matter.</p>

                <h3>The Honey & Mumford Learning Style Test</h3>
                <p>My learning style leans more toward a Reflector. I naturally like to think things over and over and
                    theorize before taking a leap to experiment or put myself into a concrete experience. I do, however,
                    push my limits and try to experiment more rather than just think over the matter.</p>

                <h3>My Ideal Job</h3>
                <p>Since diving into the IT industry, I’ve been interested in UX/UI Design because I love being
                    creative. In
                    the past I have seen job adds for UX Designers at Google in Sydney; I would love this job because
                    Google
                    appears to be a fun place to work. However, those jobs go quickly. Here is a job I believe I would
                    quite
                    enjoy: [LINK TO JOB AD PDF]</p>

                <h3>Project Idea</h3>
                <h4>ToDoTopia</h4>
                <p>ToDoTopia is a gamified productivity system for teams and individuals. It gamifies the mundane tasks
                    you
                    must do every day. Whether you’re a university student or you work as an IT professional, this app
                    will
                    gamify your work life. When you’re a part of a team, you can build a village together by checking
                    off
                    tasks on your to-do list. When you’re ready to do a Sprint, you can raid another town and compete
                    for
                    the town of the week in your country (and even world-wide!). ToDoTopia allows you to link Google
                    Drive
                    documents to any task. This is especially helpful if there are multiple people working on the same
                    task.
                    Subtasks are also a feature, streamlining your teamwork.</p>
